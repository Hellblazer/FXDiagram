{"name":"FXDiagram","tagline":"A framework for diagrams using JavaFX","body":"### Welcome to FXDiagram.\r\nFXDiagram is a framework for creating diagram tools based on JavaFX. By adding a thin layer of abstractions only, the programmer can still use the full power of JavaFX. FXDiagram provides additional library classes to selectively add higher-level functionality trimmed for best user experience. \r\n\r\nFXDiagram is almost entirely written in [Xtend] (http://www.xtend-lang.org), which allows for very concise and readable code while still being fully compatible with Java. \r\n\r\nFXDiagram integrates well with [Eclipse] (http://www.eclipse.org). Adding a diagram view for an [Xtext] (http://www.xtext.org) language is easy. Have a look at the example diagrams for Xtext's example languages *domainmodel* and *fowlerdsl*, as well as the generic class diagram browser for Java, Xtend and Xbase-languages. There is also a graphical tool for the analysis of Eclipse plug-in dependencies. To give them a try, point your Eclipse update manager to <a href=\"http://jankoehnlein.github.io/FXDiagram/p2/updates/latest\">http://jankoehnlein.github.io/FXDiagram/p2/updates/latest</a>\r\n\r\nYou can find more information on my [blog] (http://koehnlein.blogspot.com).\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nFXDiagram is currently being developed in Eclipse. The fastest way to get it running is to use [Eclipse Oomph] (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Installer) and the [FXDiagram.setup] (https://github.com/JanKoehnlein/FXDiagram/blob/master/de.fxdiagram.docs/FXDiagram.setup). The configuration requires Java 8 SDK 40 early access build >= 5 (see below) and will install everything but [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/).\r\n\r\nIf you decide to setup the environment manually, you need\r\n * Java 8 SDK 40 early access build >=5 (https://jdk8.java.net/download.html)\r\n * Eclipse Luna 4.4\r\n  * Xtext SDK 2.7\r\n  * e(fx)clipse 1.1\r\n\r\nYou need some plug-ins from the [KIELER](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/rtsys/kieler/) project. Use \r\nthe `kielerProjectSet.psf` to get them. Unfortunately, KIELER does not \r\nrun without Equinox. If you want to run the standalone demo you have to \r\napply the patch kieler.patch for some quick workarounds.\r\n\r\n[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) must be installed on your system.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFXDiagram is developed by @JanKoehnlein.
