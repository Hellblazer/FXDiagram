{"name":"FXDiagram","tagline":"A framework for diagrams using JavaFX","body":"### Welcome to FXDiagram.\r\nFXDiagram is a framework for creating diagram tools based on JavaFX. FXDiagram does not hide the power of JavaFX, but adds a thin layer of graph abstractions only. Additional library classes can be selectively added for higher-level functionality trimmed for best user experience. \r\n\r\nThe code is almost entirely written in Xtend, which allows for very concise and readable code while still being fully compatible with Java. IDE integration for Xtend is currently available for Eclipse only, but IDEA support is under development.\r\n\r\nFXDiagram offers Eclipse integration via the JavaFX-SWT-Bridge and Tom Schindl's e(fx)clipse project. There is also support for graphical views on Xtext-based models and an exemplary browser for Eclipse plug-in dependencies.\r\nTo give it a try, point your Eclipse update manager to <a href=\"http://jankoehnlein.github.io/FXDiagram/p2/updates/latest\">http://jankoehnlein.github.io/FXDiagram/p2/updates/latest</a>\r\n\r\nYou can find more information on my blog (http://koehnlein.blogspot.com).\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nFXDiagram is currently being developed in Eclipse. The fastest way to get it running is to use [Eclipse Oomph] (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_Oomph_Installer) and the [FXDiagram.setup] (https://github.com/JanKoehnlein/FXDiagram/blob/master/de.fxdiagram.docs/FXDiagram.setup). The configuration requires Java 8 SDK 40 early access build >= 5 (see below) and will install everything but [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/).\r\n\r\nIf you decide to setup the environment manually, you can use \r\n* EITHER\r\n * Java 7 SDK\r\n * Eclipse Kepler 4.3\r\n  * Xtext SDK 2.7 (including Xtend 2.7)\r\n  * e(fx)clipse 0.9 \r\n\r\n* OR\r\n * Java 8 SDK 40 early access build >=5 (https://jdk8.java.net/download.html)\r\n * Eclipse Luna 4.4\r\n  * Xtext SDK 2.7\r\n  * e(fx)clipse 1.1\r\n\t\r\nAs of version 1.0 e(fx)clipse no longer supports Java 7. If you're stuck \r\nwith Java 7 you need the e(fx)clipse version 0.9 which runs on Kepler only. \r\n\r\nYou need some plug-ins from the [KIELER](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/rtsys/kieler/) project. Use \r\nthe `kielerProjectSet.psf` to get them. Unfortunately, KIELER does not \r\nrun without Equinox. If you want to run the standalone demo you have to \r\napply the patch kieler.patch for some quick workarounds.\r\n\r\n[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) must be installed on your system.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFXDiagram is developed by @JanKoehnlein. The code is licensed under the EPL (https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html). There is currently neither support nor an official release.
