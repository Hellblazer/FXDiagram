# Welcome to FXDiagram

FXDiagram is a framework for creating diagram tools based on JavaFX. By adding a thin layer of abstractions only, the developer can still leverage the full power of JavaFX. FXDiagram provides additional library classes to selectively add higher-level functionality trimmed for best user experience.

Selected features:
- Modern graphics
- Suggestive metaphors
- Optimized for usability
- Multi-touch gestures
- Smooth transitions/animations
- Animated auto-layout (based on [KIELER](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/rtsys/kieler) and [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org))
- Animated undo/redo
- JSON persistence
- SVG export
- Xtext/Eclipse integration
- Graphical context menu
- ...and much more

FXDiagram is almost entirely written in [Xtend](http://www.xtend-lang.org), which allows for very concise and readable code while still being fully compatible with Java. 

FXDiagram runs with plain Java applications but also integrates well with [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org). Adding a diagram view for an [Xtext](http://www.xtext.org) language is easy.
